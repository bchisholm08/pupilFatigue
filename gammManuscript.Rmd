get some libraries that can help with MATLAB 
```{r}
library(R.matlab)   # To read .mat files
library(mgcv)       # For GAMM analysis

```

```{r}
mat_dir <- ['M:\Lab_Shared\Juraj\SpeechEEG_SentencesWithPupillometry\' folderName '\' sessionType subjId '\eyeTrack'];

```

# Set the directory containing your .mat files
# change to your actual directory
```{r}
mat_files <- list.files(mat_dir, pattern = "\\.mat$", full.names = TRUE)

```


# store model results in a list 
```{r}
gamm_results <- list()

```

# Loop over each subject's .mat file

```{r}
for(file in mat_files) {
  # Read the .mat file
  mat_data <- readMat(file) 
  
  # Extract data from .mat file.
  # currently uses dummy .mat variable 'data', assuming 3 columns of time, size, cond, trial 
  
  subject_df <- as.data.frame(mat_data$data)
  
  #may need to recode columns 
  
  
  
  
  # Fit GAMM:
  # Model pupil AU as a function of a smooth term over time, parametric effect of condition, and a smooth-by-condition interaction.
  # Random intercept for "trial"
  mod <- gamm(pupil ~ s(time) + condition + s(time, by = condition),
                random = list(trial = ~1),
                data = subject_df)
  
  # Use the file name with no extension as subjs id 
  subject_id <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(file))
  gamm_results[[subject_id]] <- mod
}
```

```{r}
# Review the summary of subjs model 
lapply(gamm_results, summary)
```
